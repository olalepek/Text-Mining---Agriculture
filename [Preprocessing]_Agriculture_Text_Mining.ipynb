Various strategies have been adopted by agronomists to cope these issues. In order to investigate the effect of an integrated strategy of application of biochar (Green waste), microbes (Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Azospirillum, Enterobacter) and herbicides on the growth and yield of wheat, an experiment was conducted at the farm area of the Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan during 2012-13. The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design with split plot arrangements containing three replications. The main plots were with and without the application of herbicide, while subplots carried four treatments viz. microbial inoculation, biochar application, microbial inoculation in combination with biochar, and an untreated control. Maximum grain yield (5.04 t ha-1) and yield components were recorded in herbicide treated plants with the combined application of biochar and microbes, while minimum (2.14 t ha-1) was measured in untreated control where herbicide was not applied. Biological yield and leaf area showed that both biochar and microbes in combination with herbicide application were most effective than all other treatments. It is concluded that biochar and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) along with herbicides was considered to be a best combination that enhanced the productivity of wheat.\",\n          \"The objective of this study was to evaluate plant-available N pools and the role of N management index (NMI) in the surface (0-20 cm) of a fluvo-aquic soil after 18 years of fertilization treatments under a wheat-maize cropping system in the North China Plain. The experiment included seven treatments: (1) NPK, balanced application of chemical fertilizer NPK; (2) OM, application of organic manure; (3) 1/2OMN, application of half organic manure plus chemical fertilizer NPK; (4) NP, application of chemical fertilizer NP; (5) PK, application of chemical fertilizer PK; (6) NK, application of chemical fertilizer NK; and (7) CK, unfertilized control. Total organic N (TON), microbial biomass N (MBN), labile N (LN), inorganic N (ION, including ammonium (NH4+)-N and nitrate (NO3--N) contents, net ammonification rate (NAR), net nitrification rate (NNR), net N mineralization rate (NNMR), and NMI in the fertilized treatments were higher than in the unfertilized treatment. Application of chemical fertilizer N (NPK, NP, and NK) increased ION in soils, compared with application of organic N or control. Nitrate N prevailed over exchangeable NH4+-N in all treatments. Nitrogen storage of the OM- and 1/2OMN-treated soils increased by 50. 0% and 24. 3%, respectively, over the NPK-treated soil, which had 5. 4-22. 5% more N than NP-, PK-, and NK-treated soils. The MBN, LN, and ION accounted for 1. 7-2. 4%, 25. 7-34. 2%, and 1. 4-2. 9% of TON, respectively, in different fertilization treatments. The surface soils (0-20-cm layer) in all treatments mineralized 43. 6-152. 9 kg N ha-1 year-1 for crop growth. Microbial biomass N was probably the better predictor of N mineralization, as it was correlated significantly (P &lt; 0. 01) with NNMR. The OM and 1/2OMN treatments were not an optimal option for farmers when the crop yield and labor cost were taken into consideration but an optimal option for increasing soil N supply capacity and N sequestration in soil. The NPK treatment showed the highest crop yields and increased soil N fractions through crop residues and exudates input, and thus, it may be considered as a sustainable system in the North China Plain. \\u00a9 2011 Springer-Verlag.\",\n          \"Raman spectra of charcoal fragments in cumulative soils in central Japan, where grasslands have been sustained using intentional burning for ~\\u00a01000\\u00a0years, were obtained and compared to those of fresh charcoal fragments after modern grass burning to clarify their disappearance and alteration process in the soils. Although the values of each Raman-spectrum parameter of the soil charcoal and fresh charcoal fragments are partially similar, certain differences indicating their alteration or disappearance were observed. Charcoal fragments with lower graphitization in soils altered chemically with age at decadal to century scale, suggested by changes in distance between defects or defect type of their chemical structures. Charcoal fragments with higher graphitization were found in fresh charcoal samples, whereas very few charcoal fragments were found in both young and old soils, indicating that these charcoal fragments disappeared instantly after they were formed. This fact implies that charcoal fragments with higher graphitization tend to not remain in soils, possibly owing to their physical properties such as fragility, density, and hydrodynamic behavior. Our findings suggest that charcoal's physical properties have a vital influence on charcoal residues in soils, as do charcoal's chemical properties. \\u00a9 2016 The Authors\"\n        ],\n
